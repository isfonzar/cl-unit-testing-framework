# cl-unit-testing-framework
An unit testing framework for common lisp

This unit testing framework is built for study purposes and is an implementation of the Chapter 9 of the Practical Common Lisp book by Peter Seibel

In the future I intend to improve it further and add more features as I learn more of Common Lisp.
